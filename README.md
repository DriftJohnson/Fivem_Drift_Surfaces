# Fivem_Drift_Surfaces
This Add-on Resource prevents Client Side Exploits of the Surfaces Grip &amp; Tire Heat Bell Curves. (a form of speed hacking in FiveM)
The "Surface-MASTER" release is simply setting the default values from GTAV Vanilla. 
This will override any Client side resources that have been altered, preventing this kind of Speedhack. 

It is possible to alter the dynamic of the Grip profile on all surfaces, while also allowing tire heat curves to be altered.
The "Surface-30percentless-example" shows how you can reduce the grip on all surfaces by 30%. 
This was made for Drift Servers in FiveM, however if you are a racing server, you can reverse this effect and increase grip too.

How to use:

1. Download the Resource
2. Rename the Resource folder
   eg. "surface"
3. Add this to your server.cfg as with any other resource
4. Start your server

That's it!
